1. Currently only Bus line A and Passenger are implemented. Please implement Line B an C include bus and passenger.
   At this stage you can simply the passengers are traveling in line B or line C. There are no passenger required
   transferring between bus lines.

2. Enhance the feature to include passengers transferring between bus lines.

3. Setup bus capacity limitation for example 40 people. If bus is full, there is no passenger can get on bus unless
   there are any passengers reach destination to leave the bus. Also how long bus stay at bus stop should base on how
   many passenger need to get off and on bus. (For example one passenger to get on/off bus will make bus to stay
   at bus stop for 10 seconds.)
